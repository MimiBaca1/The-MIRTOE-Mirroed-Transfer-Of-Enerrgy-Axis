## 📘 MIRTOE: Mirrored Transfer Of Energy

**MIRTOE** is a novel cosmological framework proposing a four-way interlocking wormhole structure that connects black holes and white holes across a mirrored universe. It replaces the classical singularity with a dynamic nexus point—where energy, entropy, and spacetime curvature are reconciled through time-symmetric transfer.

This theory integrates principles from general relativity, loop quantum gravity, CPT symmetry, and quantum information science. It introduces the concept of **mirror matter** as a natural stabilizer for wormholes and reframes cosmic evolution as a recursive, mirrored process of collapse and expansion.

For a full overview, see the [Research Abstract](#) and [Paper Outline](#) sections below.
